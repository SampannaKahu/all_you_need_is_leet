0.13040033,@BasicMountain it's one of my favorite things. :)
0.13261136,@BasicMountain i have some pretty fantastic wonderwoman stuff. but i prefer marvel, hands down. DC chars seem to emo.
0.21521355,pssst. @jennofhardwire, if you're going to stalk my timeline when i have you blocked, it's closer to 14k followers. https://t.co/vxxTLycP0Z
0.22470437,There is no circumstance in which threatening children is considered OK. There is no circumstance in which "triggering" is OK.
0.17550094,@mcmahoniel unfortunately, no. text filters are too high-risk.
0.3775231,@BrownBagPantry @LaurieJWillberg Hi. This isn't targeted harassment. It is not direct nor specific. You're encouraging mass reporting.
0.19293101,@the_moth_reborn :P hopefully you didn't get spammed with notifications.
0.8028341,@BrownBagPantry or perhaps twitter's userbase, and humanity at large. Everyone's a jerk sometimes.
0.10594027,@jaredchase runes on the ground, you have to step in them, thing surrounds you to absorb dmg, but it does dmg. gotta dps it slowly..
0.2843157,Yeah, I get threats. And it means I have to be cautious. But really, I'm crazy enough to think I'm unbreakable, which is why this works.
0.08660967,@BrownBagPantry to be fair, none of those things have anything to do with twitter's ToS or even free speech, for that matter. :P

0.2166806,Things I am not scared of:  Whiny manbabies. A lot of twitter mentions. Public speaking. Perl. Standing up for those that are afraid. FEELS.
0.7817486,@Chickowits i can't really hate the kids. I mean, they are just young. Stupid. Uneducated. No life experience. Who hasn't been there?
0.64089763,@lilrabmike @Chickowits said so bravely from the cowardice of an egg.
0.08608391,@jaredchase ah hah! shows how often i pve. :)  i've just been doing LFR as shadow.
0.4402631,oh, this is bad. this is really, really bad. CW: sexual assault, DC comics. (hey, DC is bad content for some) http://t.co/HM1ZJaNAa8
0.14935441,@jaredchase truth be told, i've only done normal raiding a handful of times, all in WoD. It went OK once I knew the strat. PvP is harder :)
0.7684985,@SFtheWolf the killing joke was a fucked up story arc in general &amp; could have been written better.
0.111418836,@SFtheWolf a bit of both, perhaps? def yes on the cover, maybe on the content
0.25344902,@DataFran it definitely alienates female readers if that's what they are going for. Oh wait, it's DC. YUP.

0.23256646,@chrissam42 or worst, depending on how you look at it.
0.2906263,@BrownBagPantry I get where you are coming from, and it's annoying, to be sure. But it's not considered harassment under Twitter's ToS.
0.074722424,guys. calm down. it was a joke.
0.06867256,@nscottg branch management and tying commits into a specific ticket == amaze.
0.3066187,@the_moth_reborn it is trolling.
0.06672537,@jaredchase man, i cannot figure out how to PvE as disc now that atonement is so nerfed.
0.22987962,@jaredchase i kept being the last person alive AND topping damage. it's like, what. this isn't hard.
0.14959778,@m_m_myers yup. and she rarely tells them to stop.
0.27941215,@snipeyhead basically my life
0.2830608,@SFtheWolf @max2000warlord people confuse empathy with being scared, and that says more about them than anything.
0.06826669,@jaredchase that would be awesome! I'm doing pretty well in LFR for shadow. usually in top 5 dmg, and i'm in mostly pvp gear...
0.09674129,@BrownBagPantry @LaurieJWillberg however, their accounts were mass-reported. Just asking you to not encourage this.
0.5354129,I could get hurt. Someone could come after me. Hell, people have shown up at my office before. I've been doxxed. I've been threatened.
0.7942733,@desertfox899 @SuperSpacedad @SFtheWolf the fact that it's canon doesn't make it better. DC should stay the fuck away from that.
0.08515475,"Take. Him. Back." http://t.co/9sUewKKXOY
0.12261578,omg, you guys. they are misusing the word gaslighting repeatedly. must not have gotten to that on their SJW word of the day calendar yet.
0.07224914,@BrownBagPantry But sadly, reporting just isn't the answer. Blocks/mutes &amp; ignoring is the best way to go.
0.033130474,So I don't think about it. Instead, I use it as fuel. I'd rather try to fix this so others don't have to go through this, too.
0.27856618,@BrownBagPantry @LaurieJWillberg Please stop encouraging an abuse of the reporting system.
0.21191826,EXCUSE ME KOTAKU, BUT I AM A DEVOPS, NOT JUST AN ACTIVIST.

0.12110933,@BrownBagPantry I get your frustrations. Really, I do. I deal with the same stuff every day on my own account.
0.094793834,@nscottg for my small org, it works amazingly well. has everything to do with configuration. i love the VCS integrations.
0.22505207,@BrownBagPantry @LaurieJWillberg I haven't seen anything that falls under the lines of targeted harassment in any screenshots/archives.
0.24340427,@mcmahoniel there's a lot of sarcasm and doublespeak in this group, especially. appropriation of terms. text filters just don't work.
0.069852054,@filmpunk86 i'm aware. i've read that story arc.
0.5308256,RT @max2000warlord: @freebsdgirl I highly doubt most women scare as easily as you.

0.10756216,@beardyblue never feel bad about that. it's pretty intense if you're not prepared for it.

0.12356444,@BrownBagPantry mean words aren't harassment. They aren't direct and specific threats.
0.068201326,Watch http://t.co/8YC7xTDA2U to see @TheQuinnspiracy! Just a few more minutes. :)
0.14264075,@SFtheWolf many people would be scared &amp; triggered by that cover. :P
0.07331015,@BrownBagPantry Fortunately, we've got controls on Twitter like block and mute, which keep us from seeing *most* things we don't like.
0.067469165,@SFtheWolf but the cover itself - well, the tweets capped in that article do a better job explaining than i could.
0.8987075,@SFtheWolf did you read the text of the article? that picture is really creepy/triggering as fuck.
0.81746054,@Chickowits I call out people like Jenn because she is causing problems by flooding join_oapi. It's moronic.
0.043483105,It's blurry because they were spinning in circles.
0.11067517,@WBrokenbourgh I use it on AWS constantly, but that's probably not helpful. ;)  Anything Dell tends to work fairly well, though.
0.31944892,That's why we have @join_oapi. Because going on the internet without fearing for your life should be a basic human right.

0.093854375,oh good lord. http://t.co/6RVtCzf4DF
0.057843473,@BrownBagPantry if that were the case, Twitter would probably have about 3% of the current userbase. :)
0.20383151,@SFtheWolf there are better ways to make that comic &amp; not scare off all your female customers.
0.10894479,@nscottg I love atlassian. :P
0.26425037,RT @TheQuinnspiracy: nothing changes unless we make it change. nothing fixes itself. ignoring it is like trying to throw a tarp over a bear…

0.24233492,@zip oh, gosh. if only that had been parody.
0.3007066,@FemmesinFridges yup. I have a major problem with DC and their treatment of women.
0.7884136,Combating online harassment doesn't mean jerks won't exist. Everyone is a jerk, sometimes. But you shouldn't ever be afraid.
0.2816507,@TheQuinnspiracy YOU CHANGED YOUR HAIR
0.11376391,@ashleylynch @TimofLegend It's the first time since December 2nd (when I started monitoring) that GG has complained more about a male.
0.8716207,@beardyblue it takes a pretty specific personality type to be able to take this shit on voluntarily.
0.6106293,@jaredchase but LFR is derp.
0.0884255,These are the types of tweets I get anytime @JennofHardwire mentions me. But it's really about ethics in journalism. http://t.co/RaiqA3ClqH
0.2809123,@SFtheWolf @max2000warlord no worries. the whole "you scare easily" is seriously the most hilarious thing I've seen all day.
0.15943608,Online harassment takes many forms. Some is actionable, by the service provider (ToS) or law enforcement.
0.19798468,@jaredchase this is in WoD.
0.10152477,I only have a bajillion Jira tickets to get through tonight. Then it's 3v3 arenas in WoW.  *cracks knuckles*  Let's do this.
0.1256317,@Wordy_Librarian @SFtheWolf &gt;.&gt; i did a CW.
0.83785176,@ChrisWarcraft on a side note - holy shit, i didn't know you had that many followers.
0.063985474,We seek to help clarify those policies and gain better enforcement, as well as provide users with the power to filter what they experience.
0.8931402,@MyKeyMoonShine @Grummz as gamergate has repeatedly proven, linking a URL doesn't mean shit for comprehension. &lt;3

0.17790867,@scottyswaggod but they have to follow, not lead. women know the issues they face better than men. listening is important.

0.2732411,@iglvzx @SwiftOnSecurity don't forget, we don't even *use* git. That's an export. We use svn. :P
