9136,0.4402631,oh, this is bad. this is really, really bad. CW: sexual assault, DC comics. (hey, DC is bad content for some) http://t.co/HM1ZJaNAa8
9137,0.14935441,@jaredchase truth be told, i've only done normal raiding a handful of times, all in WoD. It went OK once I knew the strat. PvP is harder :)
9138,0.7684985,@SFtheWolf the killing joke was a fucked up story arc in general &amp; could have been written better.
9139,0.111418836,@SFtheWolf a bit of both, perhaps? def yes on the cover, maybe on the content
9140,0.25344908,@DataFran it definitely alienates female readers if that's what they are going for. Oh wait, it's DC. YUP.

9145,0.2906263,@BrownBagPantry I get where you are coming from, and it's annoying, to be sure. But it's not considered harassment under Twitter's ToS.
9146,0.074722424,guys. calm down. it was a joke.
9147,0.06867256,@nscottg branch management and tying commits into a specific ticket == amaze.

9154,0.06826669,@jaredchase that would be awesome! I'm doing pretty well in LFR for shadow. usually in top 5 dmg, and i'm in mostly pvp gear...
9155,0.096741304,@BrownBagPantry @LaurieJWillberg however, their accounts were mass-reported. Just asking you to not encourage this.
9156,0.5354129,I could get hurt. Someone could come after me. Hell, people have shown up at my office before. I've been doxxed. I've been threatened.
9157,0.7942733,@desertfox899 @SuperSpacedad @SFtheWolf the fact that it's canon doesn't make it better. DC should stay the fuck away from that.

9160,0.07224914,@BrownBagPantry But sadly, reporting just isn't the answer. Blocks/mutes &amp; ignoring is the best way to go.

9188,0.14264075,@SFtheWolf many people would be scared &amp; triggered by that cover. :P
9189,0.07331015,@BrownBagPantry Fortunately, we've got controls on Twitter like block and mute, which keep us from seeing *most* things we don't like.
9190,0.06746917,@SFtheWolf but the cover itself - well, the tweets capped in that article do a better job explaining than i could.
9191,0.8987075,@SFtheWolf did you read the text of the article? that picture is really creepy/triggering as fuck.
9192,0.8174602,@Chickowits I call out people like Jenn because she is causing problems by flooding join_oapi. It's moronic.
