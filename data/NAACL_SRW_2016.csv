Not really a fan of #katieandnikki but would've rather they stayed than #katandandre #mkr
#mkr omg I want that foooooddddd &lt;3 go girls!!
"OMG can't wait to see Kat and Andre royally stuff it up in the challenges, my fingers are already starting to twitch #mkr"

It is called CRACKLING! Stop being pretentious &amp; calling it crackle.  #MKR
She is such a bee eye tea see H!!! #mkr #feistyfoodies
So it's fair for kat and Andre to score the girls a 1 even though they deserved more? You kept most hard to watch couple in the comp #mkr
I fucking hate Mkr #mkr
"Hahaha go girl! Take that, Kat #mkr"
Glad I can get back to my life now the fun part of #mkr is over and the faux Masterchef part has started.
Soooo love that Emma made a comment and had a dig at Kats strategic behaviour bout bloody time #mkr
Not scoring fairly is called cheating #mkr
What genius thought that letting teams score their competition was a good idea? Playing really dirty. #MKR
That's fucking low.. You two are pathetic! #mkr
Why don't you just give them a 0 and shut the fuck up #mkr
Maybe if Kat and Andre spent as much time focusing on cooking rather than strategy they'd actually do well  ... #MKR
RT @ineedtovent: I must say - sheri is gorgeous! Lovely person - I'd be happy to know her! #mkr

"So, that's a big double announcement for #mkr! What does everyone think?"
I feel the need to throw something at the tv. Kat doesn't deserve to go through. #MKR #bitch
Ok I officially dislike Kat the most #mkr
Don't understand how bad sportsmanship can be condoned by #mkr #strategicscoring
Kat just loving the negative reviews. #MKR
You won't last long Kat and Andre... Others there can cook...  #mkr
Kat and Andre do not deserve to be in the competition #dogs #mkr
How hard is it to be humble?  #MKR
I thought they were going to make the top teams go through another instant restaurant round! #mkr
Ol' Crazy Eyes lives to massacre another menu #MKR
I am loving #mkr. So. Much. To. Hate.
Bad sportsmanship by Kat. Un Australian!! #mkr
"I'm absolutely disgusted. Kat and Andre don't deserve to stay in this competition. They didnt vote strategically, they flat out cheated #mkr"

"Kat and Andre suck!! They deserve to go home, not the girls #mkr @mykitchenrules"
Not that I watch it but still aha #mkr
@cmsavage71 I can't believe the result! I would have voted strategically to make sure Kat and Andre didn't make it!! #mkr
I'm actually disappointed. The WA couple are horrible. On the plus side they'll go home quickly because their cooking SUCKS #MKR
I just want Manu to stay. #MKR

Booo Kat and Andre did not deserve to get through #mkr
HOW THE FUCK ARE KAT AND ANDRE STILL IN THE COMPETITION FUCK #MKR

Voting strategically is not 'fighting hard' Kat. I don't like #Katie&amp;Nikki but I wish they pulled thru despite ur score #MKR
"Maybe it was just a typo. They meant to list ""Kickass ice-cream and apple pie."" #MKR"
Kat survived? Is this real life? #mkr

Kat and Andre why are you cheering you are now the worst team in he comp...#MKR
I don't even remember any of these people #mkr
Ass cream?? #mkr #mkr2015
So @AshleighIsabel is watching #MKR. I have to say that Kat seems like an absolute crazy bitch..

"Ripped off! Poor girls, that's ridiculous! #mkr"

They need a couple of 8's? #MKR
Proof there is no God.   Kat survives.   #mkr
Bad news: Kat and Andre are in  Good news: no more horrendous voting from teams #mkr
Goodbye Katie and Nikki! #MKR

#mkr NOOOOO!!! I wanted Kat and Andre to lose!!!
I will have to switch off if kat and andre make it through #mkr. I won't be able to handle the tsunami of smugness.
I DONT know how I feel this way...  But I won't the bloody blondes to stay.  THATS just how horrid Kat is.  #mkr
Noooooo #mkr whyyyyy
Lol an 8 from Pete is definitely strategic. Strategic to increase TV ratings. #MKR

Can they just send Kat and Andre home anyway because they're rude and annoying and score everyone strategically  #MKR
#MKR Ladies. Manu is not excited about the prospect of your entree. He's excited about the prospect of you going home.
Hurry up! Kat and Andre are dicks #mkr
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!  #MKR
Kat and Andre are the sort of people who would look forward to funerals knowing they will be getting a free feed afterwards. #MKR
Kat and Andre are now more hated than Adam and Carol. #mkr

Out of Pravana blue. Guess I'm stuck with mixing some clear with Special FX Turquoise to layer over existing hair. hmm. This might be good.
@Jules_Clarke @jmcefalas has more emotional impact when it's the face of a person reading it out loud.
@kencf0618 Being blocked isn't harassment.
@milfgaardian have you tried pravana?
